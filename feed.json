				"title": "Throw some Results ",
				"content_html": "<p>Errors, we&rsquo;ve all got &lsquo;em.  What do we do with &lsquo;em?</p>\n\n<p>Swift has a couple of different error handling patterns.  There&rsquo;s <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> which I always think of as kind of the nuclear option.  Something went wrong, the code blows up with a <code>throw</code> and our hero, the intrepid programmer, has to deal with it right here, right now.  And then there&rsquo;s <code>Result</code>, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.  Call a method and get back a <code>Result</code>, then deal with it as you like &ndash; check for the value, handle the error or maybe even ignore it altogether.  Depending on your situation, one of these is likely to suit better than the other.</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes the situation changes.  Maybe you wrote some code that should obviously <code>throw</code>(or calls some library code that <code>throws</code>), but it would really make a lot more sense to return a <code>Result</code>.  As it turns out, it&rsquo;s really easy to convert between <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> and a <code>Result</code> type.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you have some code that can <code>throw</code>.  Maybe even it always throws, because it is a <code>badIdea()</code>.  But you need to have a <code>Result</code> instance instead.  The <code>Result</code> type has an initializer that handles this perfectly.  You hand it a closure that returns the <code>Success</code> type for the <code>Result</code> and any error thrown by the closure is used for the <code>Failure</code> case.

				"content_text": "Errors, we've all got 'em.  What do we do with 'em?\r\n\r\nSwift has a couple of different error handling patterns.  There's `try` and `catch` which I always think of as kind of the nuclear option.  Something went wrong, the code blows up with a `throw` and our hero, the intrepid programmer, has to deal with it right here, right now.  And then there's `Result`, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.  Call a method and get back a `Result`, then deal with it as you like -- check for the value, handle the error or maybe even ignore it altogether.  Depending on your situation, one of these is likely to suit better than the other.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the situation changes.  Maybe you wrote some code that should obviously `throw`(or calls some library code that `throws`), but it would really make a lot more sense to return a `Result`.  As it turns out, it's really easy to convert between `try`/`catch` and a `Result` type.\r\n\r\nImagine you have some code that can `throw`.  Maybe even it always throws, because it is a `badIdea()`.  But you need to have a `Result` instance instead.  The `Result` type has an initializer that handles this perfectly.  You hand it a closure that returns the `Success` type for the `Result` and any error thrown by the closure is used for the `Failure` case.  Basically, they've wrapped up all the boilerplate in this initializer, and you get a very concise way to convert `try` into a `Result`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nenum HorrendousError: Error {\r\n    case veryBad\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc badIdea() throws -> String {\r\n    throw HorrendousError.veryBad\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet result = Result<String, Error> { try badIdea() }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full signature of that initializer is `Result.init(catching: () -> Success)`.  The single argument is a closure returns the `Success` type -- here that's a `String`.  If the closure throws, then that gets wrapped up as the `.failure` case. \r\n\r\nHow about doing the reverse?  You've got a result type, but you'd rather access the value in a `try` / `catch` sort of way.  The `Result` type itself has a accessor method for just such an occasion!\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet value = try someResult.get()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `Result` type is the `.success` case, it just returns the successful value.  If `someResult` is a `.failure` case, the `get()` method will `throw`.  This is especially useful if you want to access the result and ignore any errors:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet optionalValue = try? someResult.get()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also handy in testing when you expect a `Result` type to be successful.  Use the `get()` method to access the value and let `XCTest`'s support for tests that `throw` to handle the error cases.  This can make tests shorter and easier to read too.\r\n\r\nFor me, discovering the interchangeable nature of `try`/`catch` and the `Result` type was a bit of an 'aha!' moment.  You're not locked in to on type of error handling or another.  With these convenient converters, you can fluidly move from one type to another as needed.  And without a lot of boilerplate code for the conversions!  \n",
