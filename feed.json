I&rsquo;ve been working on the next round of features for <a href=\"https://www.sonicbunny.com/GlowWorm/\">GlowWorm</a> including a desktop widget.  The GlowWidget, like every widget ever, needs to share some data with the main app.  Widgets are all sandboxed and locked down, so we need to use an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups\">App Group</a> to enable sharing between the extension and the main app.  This is where it gets weird.</p>\n\n<p>The internet is full of info on how to set up app groups.  It starts by going to the developer portal, creating a group and adding it to the app identifier.  Groups created in the dev portal are always prefixed with <code>group.</code>.  Once you&rsquo;ve got that set up, you can add the App Group in the capabilities section of the Xcode project.  Here&rsquo;s the rub!  For a Mac app, Xcode enforces that the app group begin with the developer&rsquo;s Team ID which looks something like <code>JQ49SEDXYZ</code>.  So&hellip; does it start with <code>group.</code> or does it start with <code>JQ49SEDXYZ.</code>?</p>\n\n<p>The key info is summed up in this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/66639271\">SO post</a> and sort of in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups\">docs</a>.  It turns out that Mac and iOS configs are completely different!  The dev portal and the <code>group.</code> prefix is <em>only for iOS</em>.  None of that needs to be done for Mac (like nothing at all in the dev portal).  On the Mac, you just need to use the Team ID prefix and that&rsquo;s it.  The only setup is in the Capabilities section of Xcode, where you add an app group with your Team ID prefix, bundle ID and whatever suffix you&rsquo;d like.  For a bundle ID of <code>com.example.app</code>, you might make the app group <code>JQ49SEDXYZ.com.example.app.shared</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got an app group, make sure you&rsquo;ve added that app group capability to all the relevant targets.  For GlowWorm, it needs to be added to the main app as well as the widget.  There are a couple of ways you can share data between the two targets now, but initially we&rsquo;re only interested in sharing <code>UserDefaults</code>.  To do that, you need to create an instance of <code>UserDefaults</code> explicitly associated with the app group.  Using the example app group we&rsquo;ve set up, you can create the shared instance with <code>UserDefaults(suiteNamed: &quot;JQ49SEDXYZ.com.example.app.shared&quot;)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>And with that, we&rsquo;re in business!  Both the main app and the extension can access the data in the shared user defaults.  Now we just have to make it look pretty.  🙈</p>\n",

For a Mac app, Xcode enforces that the app group begin with the developer's Team ID which looks something like `JQ49SEDXYZ`.  So... does it start with `group.` or does it start with `JQ49SEDXYZ.`?  \n\nThe key info is summed up in this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66639271) and sort of in the [docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups).  It turns out that Mac and iOS configs are completely different!  The dev portal and the `group.` prefix is _only for iOS_.  None of that needs to be done for Mac (like nothing at all in the dev portal).  On the Mac, you just need to use the Team ID prefix and that's it.  The only setup is in the Capabilities section of Xcode, where you add an app group with your Team ID prefix, bundle ID and whatever suffix you'd like.  For a bundle ID of `com.example.app`, you might make the app group `JQ49SEDXYZ.com.example.app.shared`.  \n\nNow that you've got an app group, make sure you've added that app group capability to all the relevant targets.  For GlowWorm, it needs to be added to the main app as well as the widget.  There are a couple of ways you can share data between the two targets now, but initially we're only interested in sharing `UserDefaults`.  To do that, you need to create an instance of `UserDefaults` explicitly associated with the app group.  Using the example app group we've set up, you can create the shared instance with `UserDefaults(suiteNamed: \"JQ49SEDXYZ.com.example.app.shared\")`.\n\nAnd with that, we're in business!  Both the main app and the extension can access the data in the shared user defaults.  Now we just have to make it look pretty.  🙈\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s about a week before WWDC 2023 kicks off in sunny California, so here&rsquo;s a list of things I&rsquo;m hoping to see come out of Cupertino.  I&rsquo;m skipping the AR/VR stuff, since it&rsquo;s been speculated ad nauseam.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be cool and awesome and weird and probably not cheap.  And maybe it&rsquo;ll make me dizzy</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR; Better Xcode, Better Siri, Better Mac Catalyst</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"xcode\">Xcode</h2>\n\n<p>Mostly, I just want Xcode to be better.  Don&rsquo;t crash.  Don&rsquo;t be slow.  Is that too much to ask?</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"spm-handling\">SPM Handling</h4>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen it.  Switch branches, hit build and be faced with</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Build operations are disabled: Package loading in progress. Please try again later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I spend a lot of time working on <a href=\"https://www.callistoapp.com\">Callisto</a>, which is kind of a big app.  We have dependencies split out into frameworks and it can take SPM <em>a while</em> to resolve all the packages when switching branches.  So I hit this quite a lot.  Usually, Xcode does a great job of queueing up actions when it&rsquo;s busy.  Like if you do a clean build and then run unit tests, it will finish the clean and then do the testing.  That&rsquo;s all I want for SPM resolution.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"better-swiftui-tooling\">Better SwiftUI Tooling</h4>\n\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t written a lot of SwiftUI.  We toyed with it early on building <a href=\"https://www.callistoapp.com\">Callisto</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t ready for a big project like that.  A couple months ago, we thought about trying to build a screen here or there with SwiftUI, but ran into roadblocks.  One of the key features of SwiftUI is the <em>live preview</em>.  To make those work, Xcode compiles bits of your code behind the scenes and shows them in preview pane.  <a href=\"https://www.callistoapp.com\">Callisto</a> is a Catalyst app but has an AppKit plugin for doing Mac system things.  Xcode could not handle that when trying to make a SwiftUI preview.  Xcode would try to compile the AppKit code with UIKit and become very upset when it didn&rsquo;t work.  That left our foray into SwiftUI dead in the water.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"siri-for-xcode\">Siri for Xcode</h4>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve dabbled a bit with ChatGPT as a coding assistant.

HKSV (HomeKit Secure Video) records events from these cameras and saves to iCloud, but scrolling back through time is only available via Apple&rsquo;s Home app.  Third party apps aren&rsquo;t able to access the history of clips because there&rsquo;s just no API for it.

When I try to open an app in my Applications folder with the phrase &ldquo;Open AppName&rdquo;, it fails maybe 2 out of 3 times.

Why can&rsquo;t Siri to do that in Xcode?  Imagine an Apple trained <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\">LLM</a> that especially knew about Swift, UIKit, and all the Apple technologies.

But the two devices remained separate at a hardware level &ndash; a smart speaker and a TV streamer.  I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the hybrid devices for <em>years</em> now.  There&rsquo;s the HomePod with a screen, like an Amazon Echo Show, that does HomePod things, but augmented with a display.  And there&rsquo;s the AppleTV with a mic and speaker.

				"content_text": "It's about a week before WWDC 2023 kicks off in sunny California, so here's a list of things I'm hoping to see come out of Cupertino.  I'm skipping the AR/VR stuff, since it's been speculated ad nauseam.  I'm sure it'll be cool and awesome and weird and probably not cheap.  And maybe it'll make me dizzy\n\n> TLDR; Better Xcode, Better Siri, Better Mac Catalyst\n\n## Xcode\n\nMostly, I just want Xcode to be better.  Don't crash.  Don't be slow.  Is that too much to ask?\n\n#### SPM Handling\n\nWe've all seen it.  Switch branches, hit build and be faced with\n\n> Build operations are disabled: Package loading in progress. Please try again later.\n\nI spend a lot of time working on [Callisto](https://www.callistoapp.com), which is kind of a big app.  We have dependencies split out into frameworks and it can take SPM _a while_ to resolve all the packages when switching branches.  So I hit this quite a lot.  Usually, Xcode does a great job of queueing up actions when it's busy.  Like if you do a clean build and then run unit tests, it will finish the clean and then do the testing.  That's all I want for SPM resolution.\n\n#### Better SwiftUI Tooling\n\nI haven't written a lot of SwiftUI.  We toyed with it early on building [Callisto](https://www.callistoapp.com), but it wasn't ready for a big project like that.  A couple months ago, we thought about trying to build a screen here or there with SwiftUI, but ran into roadblocks.  One of the key features of SwiftUI is the _live preview_.  To make those work, Xcode compiles bits of your code behind the scenes and shows them in preview pane.  [Callisto](https://www.callistoapp.com) is a Catalyst app but has an AppKit plugin for doing Mac system things.  Xcode could not handle that when trying to make a SwiftUI preview.  Xcode would try to compile the AppKit code with UIKit and become very upset when it didn't work.  That left our foray into SwiftUI dead in the water.\n\n#### Siri for Xcode\n\nI've dabbled a bit with ChatGPT as a coding assistant.  It's great for small tasks with fiddly parameters.  For instance, I needed to get the timestamp of some files.  That's the kind of thing that's straightforward, but you don't do it often, so you have to look up the specific API to stat the file and which attributes correspond to the creation date / modification date, etc.  ChatGPT spit that code right out and I could move on to other things.  But there's friction there and the opportunity for a bespoke Xcode experience.  I'm cautiously optimistic Apple will do something in this space, but I'm afraid it won't be groundbreaking.  Because, you know... Siri.\n\n## Catalyst and iOS Updates\n\nSince [Callisto](https://www.callistoapp.com) is built with Mac Catalyst, these are the sorts of updates we'd love to see as developers.\n\n#### Dynamic Type on Mac\n\nDynamic Type on iOS has been around for 10+ years.  That's the bit in iOS Settings that lets you make the text on your device a little bigger or a lot bigger than standard.  All the apps that support Dynamic Type will pick up the change and text across the whole device changes size.  That's great!  A boon for aging eyes everywhere. \n\nBut it isn't supported at all on macOS.  This [recent announcement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/) about new accessibility features coming in iOS 17 mentions \n\n> For users with low vision, Text Size is now easier to adjust across Mac apps such as Finder, Messages, Mail, Calendar, and Notes.\n\nThat sounds a lot like Dynamic Text on the Mac, so fingers crossed. \n\n#### Auxiliary Window Replacement\n\nBack in the day, lots of Mac apps used auxiliary windows that served as things like inspectors and floating tool panels.  Apps like Photoshop had a bunch of these -- paintbrushes, color panels, etc.  You can still see these in AppKit apps like Preview and Quicktime Player, where the inspector is an auxiliary window.  When you switch apps, it disappears to cut down on clutter.  Right now, there's nothing like that for Catalyst.  The UIScene API for managing windows doesn't have that level of distinction.  Hopefully, at WWDC we'll see a more mature Stage Manager implementation and at least some way of distinguishing main content windows and helper windows.\n\n#### Multiple Processes on iOS\n\n[Callisto](https://www.callistoapp.com) includes an embedded Python distribution for running the Jupyter Python Kernel.  On the Mac, we just spawn a separate process and run Python normally.  On iPad, we use a heavily modified Python to run in the same process space as the app to comply with App Store requirements.  In practice, that hamstrings [Callisto](https://www.callistoapp.com) on the iPad a great deal.  With a renewed interest in [Pro apps](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-brings-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-to-ipad/) on the iPad, it'd be incredible if we were allowed to run multiple processes and level the playing field between an M1 iPad and an M1 MacBook.  \n\nYeah, never going to happen.\n\n## Other Stuff\n\n#### Passwords\n\nA lot of folks have called for a dedicated Passwords app instead of burying password management in Settings.  I'm all for that, but I'd also love to see password sharing via your Apple Family.  That's really the last feature I'd need to leave 1Password behind.  1Password has been fantastic, but they've really pivoted to a corporate focus, so they're less of good fit when I just want to share the Netflix password with my family.  (Only for persons in my immediate family, residing in the same household.  Netflix, if you're reading this, I promise.)\n\n#### HKSV Streaming API\n\nI'm pretty heavily invested in the HomeKit ecosystem and I'm mostly happy with it.  (I'm looking at you Siri.)

HKSV (HomeKit Secure Video) records events from these cameras and saves to iCloud, but scrolling back through time is only available via Apple's Home app.  Third party apps aren't able to access the history of clips because there's just no API for it.

Jon Reid <a href=\"https://qualitycoding.org/ios-app-delegate-testing/\">has a write-up</a> of how to do this with a UIKit app by swapping out the app delegate during tests.  But SwiftUI introduces a whole new startup sequence so we need a new approach for SwiftUI&rsquo;s new app lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p>After some futzing around, turns out it&rsquo;s easy!</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">struct TestApp: App {\t\t\t\t\t// 1\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            Text(&quot;I'm running tests!&quot;)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n@main\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// 2\nstruct TestDriver {\n    static func main() {\n        if NSClassFromString(&quot;XCTestCase&quot;) != nil {    // 3\n            TestApp.main()\n        } else {\n            MyRealApp.main()\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are three key points that make this work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>We need a dummy `App` struct to use instead of the real app.  This simple stand-in circumvents all your usual app startup machinery.  Instead of all the normal bootstrapping, we'll just get a window with the text \"I'm running tests!\".</li>\n<li>Remove the `@main` from your `App` implementation and add it here to `TestDriver`.  Swift uses `@main` to figure out how to start your app.  The `App` protocol provides a default implementation that, according to the docs, 'manages the launch process in a platform-appropriate way'.  But by inserting our own wrapper layer here around, we can control _which_ `main()` is called.</li>\n<li>That brings us to the final point, use the good old `NSClassFromString` to decide if the testing bundle has been injected into our process.  `XCTestCase` is only available during testing, so this is a reliable way to decide if unit testing is underway.  Based on that, we can call the `main` method of either our real app or our testing stand-in.  It turns out that the default implementation of `main` knows to use its parent struct to bootstrap the SwiftUI app.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now when I run unit tests, my coverage is at 0.8%!  That&rsquo;s more like it.  In order to boost my test coverage, I now have to actually test code.  And the code coverage metric really starts to mean something.</p>\n",

But SwiftUI introduces a whole new startup sequence so we need a new approach for SwiftUI's new app lifecycle.\n\nAfter some futzing around, turns out it's easy!\n\n```swift\nstruct TestApp: App {\t\t\t\t\t// 1\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            Text(\"I'm running tests!\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n@main\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// 2\nstruct TestDriver {\n    static func main() {\n        if NSClassFromString(\"XCTestCase\") != nil {    // 3\n            TestApp.main()\n        } else {\n            MyRealApp.main()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere are three key points that make this work:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>We need a dummy `App` struct to use instead of the real app.  This simple stand-in circumvents all your usual app startup machinery.  Instead of all the normal bootstrapping, we'll just get a window with the text \"I'm running tests!\".</li>\n<li>Remove the `@main` from your `App` implementation and add it here to `TestDriver`.  Swift uses `@main` to figure out how to start your app.  The `App` protocol provides a default implementation that, according to the docs, 'manages the launch process in a platform-appropriate way'.  But by inserting our own wrapper layer here around, we can control _which_ `main()` is called.</li>\n<li>That brings us to the final point, use the good old `NSClassFromString` to decide if the testing bundle has been injected into our process.  `XCTestCase` is only available during testing, so this is a reliable way to decide if unit testing is underway.  Based on that, we can call the `main` method of either our real app or our testing stand-in.  It turns out that the default implementation of `main` knows to use its parent struct to bootstrap the SwiftUI app.</li>\n</ol>\n\nNow when I run unit tests, my coverage is at 0.8%!  That's more like it.  In order to boost my test coverage, I now have to actually test code.  And the code coverage metric really starts to mean something.\n",
